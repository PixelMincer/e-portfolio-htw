        So why do I study <span class="keyword black">DBM</span> at HTW Chur? First and foremost I find it a very important skill in todays society to be able to innovate and <span class="keyword black">think outside the box</span>. With this said I
        think the DBM study gives me the following benefits:
      </p>

      <ul class="black">
        <li>Create and test new solutions directly with the market</li>
        <li>Getting to know project management</li>
        <li>Staying on the rising edge of technology</li>
        <li>Getting to know basic concepts in order to run a business</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text black">
        I think these skills and experiences are really. In my free time and during my job I have more of the technical aspects and during study I learn really valuable skills. This way I can get <span class="keyword black">the best of both worlds</span>.
      </p>

    <div class="title">
      <h1># My Vision</h1>
    </div>
    <article id="myVision">
      <p class="text-black">
        For me a vision has to do with what <span class="keyword black">I love the most</span>. This may not bring in the most amount of money or be the most easiest thing but I will definiely be the thing I will enjoy the most. With this said I
        would
        like to try following my dream which is <span class="keyword black">becoming a video game developer</span>. Here I have multiple possiblities:
      </p>

      <ul class="black">
        <li>Create a startup</li>
        <li>Join an existing company</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-black">
        Lets analyze these opportunities. If I were to create a startup I would need the necessary amount of founding money. Besides money I would need the necesary people. As you can imagine making a video games involves various disciplines such as
        programming, creating assets, composing music or composing the scenario just to name a few. Then there is the problem with reaching the critical mass once the product is finished which is not perticularly easy esspecially in Switzerland. <br>
        <br>

        Joining an existing company is more feasable but also quite a task in itself. For one thing game developing companies in Switzerland are very rare. Your best shot is therefore going abroad to a country like Japan or USA. Besides the
        difficulty
        of landing a job there is also a considerable language barrier to keep in mind. <br>
        <br>

        So I must be nuts to try and archieve something like this right? Well otherwise it would be a pretty boring vision there has to be some sort of challenge to it. For me it means I have to develop and hone the necessary skills to make this
        possible one step at a time. A wall is also not build in a day but brick by brick, day by day, step by step.
